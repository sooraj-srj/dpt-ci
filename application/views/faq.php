<br>
<span style="color:#3399ff;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>I do not want to visit few places as mentioned in your website. Can we amend the itinerary as per our wish?</strong></span></span><br>
<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:16px;">Yes, our itinerary is very much flexible. Our vehicle and guides are exclusively for you and at your disposal. Hence you may alter or customize the itinerary, pick up time, places of visit and time to be spent at each destination, depending on your wish. &nbsp;You may kindly coordinate with your respective guide on the day of tour for the same and he / she shall be happy to be at your assistance.</span></span><br>
<br>
<span style="color:#3399ff;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>Are tickets to Burj Khalifa included in the tour price?</strong>&nbsp;</span></span><br>
<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:16px;">We are sorry. Unfortunately, our city tour doesn’t include a visit inside Burj Khalifa but only a picture stop.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Visit to Burj Khalifa will consume 1 hour and hence, there will be additional amount of USD 40 per hour to avail vehicle by extending the tour<br>
We suggest, we shall end the tour by dropping you at Burj Khalifa. This will enable you to spend more time in Burj Khalifa and shopping in Dubai mall. From there, you will be able to get taxi back to hotel / airport.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
At the time of online reservation, they will be sending a unique code to your mobile number as well as we will need your credit card details. Hence we kindly request you to make the booking directly through the below link www.atthetop.ae for Burj Khalifa tickets<br>
&nbsp;</span></span><br>
<span style="color:#3399ff;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>Can we have child seat? Do we need to pay additional?&nbsp;</strong></span></span><br>
<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:16px;">Yes, we can arrange for no extra cost. However, please check with us for availability of same.&nbsp;</span></span><br>
<br>
<span style="color:#3399ff;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>What is the dress code practice in UAE?&nbsp;</strong></span></span><br>
<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:16px;">Being an Islamic nation, the UAE is modest about its dress code. You can wear shorts but any form of revealing / transparent clothing is considered inappropriate in public.</span></span><br>
<br>
<span style="color:#3399ff;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>What is the tipping policy?</strong>&nbsp;</span></span><br>
<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:16px;">Gratuity is not included in tour price. There is no appropriate amount as such to tip. Tipping can be done according to your interest and satisfaction. It’s out of your generosity. Generally its 10-20% of the tour price we give us a tip. Still there is no compulsion.</span></span><br>
<br>
<span style="color:#3399ff;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>Is Falcon Show included in Desert Safari?&nbsp;</strong></span></span><br>
<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:16px;">Falcon display is a different program which we outsource. It’s difficult and expensive for us to have, train and protect a Falcon. Not everyone has it. An additional amount of AED 1500 will be applicable if you would like to include that in our itinerary. Hence it’s expensive.</span></span><br>
<br>
<span style="color:#3399ff;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>Emirates will tell us our hotel once after we land. How can we make the booking on website?</strong>&nbsp;</span></span><br>
<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:16px;">No worries. Once you get to know your hotel, you may kindly call our below emergency numbers (+971552501818 OR +971559554333) OR drop us an email and inform us your hotel and we shall instruct our guide and send him accordingly.&nbsp;</span></span><br>

<span style="color:#3399ff;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>What is the difference between Ferrari World General Tickets and Premium tickets?&nbsp;</strong></span></span><br>
<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:16px;">Under General tickets, before entering each ride, there will be Queue and you will need to wait for your turn. Premium tickets are the VIP tickets wherein you will have the privilege to step into all the rides without standing in Queue.</span></span><br>
<br>
<span style="color:#3399ff;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>Is the prices mentioned on the website per person rate? If we are a party of 2, do we still need to pay for 4 people?</strong>&nbsp;</span></span><br>
<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:16px;">The prices mentioned on our website are not per person rate. We do not conduct tours on sharing basis but only on private basis. Hence for upto 4 people our tour price is constant</span></span><br>

Is there restroom facilities while on desert safari?&nbsp;<br>

<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:16px;">The only difference is in the places. Marina is the new part of Dubai and creek is the Old part of Dubai. Compared to the views in Creek, Marina is better. We serve food from JW Marriott in Marina and Radisson in Creek. &nbsp;<br>
